# /gsr:build — Build Skill

You are executing the `/gsr:build` command. Your job is to build a specific feature from the project's feature files.

---

## Iron Laws

1. **Never claim done without evidence.** Run the gate function before every completion claim. Evidence format: "build passes (0 errors), TS clean." Never "should work."
2. **Corrections compound.** Every correction the user makes → ask "Should I add this to CLAUDE.md Learned Rules?" If yes, append it with today's date.
3. **Skills are mandatory, not optional.** Skills are matched to tasks in Step 3.5. Do not skip the verification gate. Do not start implementing before skills are confirmed.
4. **Never reference assets that don't exist.** No placeholder image URLs, no `src="/images/..."` pointing to nonexistent files, no icon references without the icon being present. If UI needs a graphic, use inline SVG, CSS shapes, unicode characters, or descriptive text. Hallucinated images break user trust instantly.
5. **Tests match what's built.** Only give testing instructions for features that are actually implemented and functional. Never list test scenarios for placeholder/coming-soon screens. If a feature depends on an unbuilt feature, say so explicitly: "Upload works, but full flow needs Configure built next."

---

## Step 0: Setup

Read these files before doing anything else:
1. `CLAUDE.md` — conventions, references, learned rules
2. `docs/STATE.md` — current phase and feature status
3. `docs/techstack.md` — project-wide skills

### Infrastructure Pre-Check

After reading `docs/techstack.md`, scan for external services that require provisioning before code can run (Supabase, Firebase, PlanetScale, Neon, Stripe, Clerk, etc.).

For each external service found, check if it's already confirmed as live:
- Look for a `.env` or `.env.local` file with the relevant credentials/URLs
- If credentials are present → assume provisioned, proceed silently
- If credentials are missing or no `.env` exists → ask the user before proceeding:

```
Before we build: your stack uses [Service]. Is it set up?

1. Yes — project created, credentials in .env
2. Not yet — I'll set it up now

(Setting it up now means no migration step at verify time.)
```

Wait for confirmation. Do not start feature selection until the user confirms infrastructure is ready or explicitly chooses to proceed without it.

**Why this matters:** Building against an unprovisioned service means code that can't run during verification. Setting up first means tables/schema are created fresh — no migration needed later.

---

## Step 1: Feature Selection

Show the user available features with their current status:

```
Available features — Phase 1: [Phase Name]

1. [Feature name] — not started
2. [Feature name] — not started
3. [Feature name] — in progress

Which feature do you want to build? (or "all" to build entire phase)
```

Read feature statuses from `docs/STATE.md`.

**Batch build:** If the user says "all", "build everything", "whole phase", or similar — switch to batch mode:
1. Build features sequentially in dependency order
2. Use Creative mode for UI features, Systematic for non-UI (auto-classify using the Task Classification Heuristic)
3. Run mini-verification after each feature, but don't stop to ask "which feature next?" — proceed automatically
4. After each feature: give a one-line status update ("Upload done ✓ — moving to Configure") instead of full test instructions
5. Give full test instructions only at the end, covering all built features together
6. If you hit a blocking error or ambiguity requiring a product decision, stop and ask — then resume batch after the answer

The user can also interrupt batch mode at any time to switch to feature-by-feature.

---

## Step 2: Load Feature Context

Once the user picks a feature, read:
1. `docs/STATE.md` — check that all prerequisite features for this feature are done
2. `docs/features/<name>.md` — the complete product spec
3. `docs/techstack.md` — project-wide skills

**Prerequisite check:** Before loading anything else, scan the feature file for dependencies on other features. Cross-reference with STATE.md. If any prerequisite feature is `not started`, `in progress`, or `blocked`: use the decision gate pattern (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/patterns/decision-gate.md`). Enter plan mode and present:

**Option 1 — Build [prerequisite] first**
Safe path. Avoids integration failures mid-build.

**Option 2 — Proceed anyway**
You accept the risk of hitting integration gaps. Can be unblocked later.

**Recommendation: Option 1** — building on an incomplete dependency typically means rework.

Wait for user to click. Do not proceed silently.

**Load project-wide skills now.** Read each skill's SKILL.md from `docs/techstack.md`. Skills matched to specific tasks happen after the task list is generated — see Step 3.5.

**Resume check (Mode B only):** After loading the feature file, scan `docs/plans/` for a plan file where the `feature` frontmatter matches the current feature slug and `status: in_progress`. If one exists, present:

> Found an in-progress plan for `<feature>` at `docs/plans/<slug>.md`. Last updated: <date>.
> 1. Resume — continue from last incomplete task
> 2. Start fresh — discard and rebuild the task list

Wait for user choice before proceeding to Step 3. On Resume: skip to the execution loop in Mode B, starting from the first task with `status: pending` or `status: in-progress`.

---

## Step 2.5: Design Sketch Gate

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/patterns/feature-sketch.md` for full pattern doc.

**Skip this step entirely if** `FORCE_SKETCH` is not set AND none of the heuristic conditions below trigger.

**Heuristic — fire the gate if any of these are true in the feature file:**
1. Fewer than 3 concrete states (empty / loading / error / success / offline / partial) mentioned
2. No acceptance criteria or done-when language in the must-haves section
3. Explicit `TBD`, `?`, or `decide during build` markers anywhere in the file
4. Feature declares dependencies on >3 other features

If `FORCE_SKETCH=true` (user passed `--sketch`): fire regardless of heuristic.

**When the gate fires**, propose the sketch inline:

> **Design sketch for `<feature>`**
> **Approach:** <one paragraph>
> **File map:** <what to add / change>
> **Data shape:** <if feature handles data; omit if purely presentational>
> **What could break:** <one line>
> **Out of scope:** <explicit list>
>
> 1. Approve — append sketch to feature file and proceed
> 2. Edit — tell me what to change, I'll revise
> 3. Skip — I know what I'm building

On **Approve**: append to `docs/features/<name>.md` as a new section:
```markdown
## Build Sketch — <YYYY-MM-DD>
<sketch content>
```
Then proceed to Step 3.

On **Edit**: revise the sketch and re-present. Loop until Approve or Skip.

On **Skip**: proceed to Step 3 silently. No file written.

---

## Step 3: Mode Selection

Use the decision gate pattern (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/patterns/decision-gate.md`). Enter plan mode and present:

**Option 1 — Creative**
You review every diff as it's written. Best for UI, screens, design-sensitive work.

**Option 2 — Systematic**
Claude generates a task list, you approve it, then Claude executes. Best for testing, i18n, accessibility, security, refactoring.

**Recommendation: Creative** if the feature has any UI. Systematic if it's purely backend/infrastructure.

User clicks their choice.

---

## Step 3.5: Skills Matching + Verification

Run this step regardless of mode, after the task list (Mode B) or file map (Mode A) is drafted — before anything executes.

### Output-type pre-filter (before per-task matching)

Before matching skills to individual tasks, check the **output type** of the overall deliverable. If the output will be seen by human eyes — UI screens, slides, landing pages, HTML files, PDFs, email templates, presentations — then a design/frontend-design skill is required regardless of framework or technology used.

Search for a design skill explicitly:
```bash
npx skills find frontend-design
npx skills find design
```

"Just HTML", "no React", "single file", or "no build step" do not exempt this. The skill exists to inject aesthetic quality criteria (layout, typography, spacing, visual hierarchy) — those apply to any visual output, not just component frameworks.

If no design skill is found or installed: surface this explicitly as a warning before proceeding. Do not silently continue without it for visual deliverables.

### Match skills to tasks

For each task (or file group in Mode A), identify what technical capabilities it needs. Search the skills.sh marketplace for matching skills:

```bash
npx skills find <topic>   # e.g. npx skills find supabase, npx skills find mapbox, npx skills find testing
```

Build a verification table:

```
## Skills for [Feature Name]

| Task | Skill | Status | Install |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| [task] | [skill-name] | installed / not installed | [install command] |
| [task] | — | no skill found | rely on docs |
```

If a skill covers multiple tasks, list it once and note which tasks it applies to.

### Verification gate

Present the table to the user. Use the decision gate pattern (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/patterns/decision-gate.md`) for any skill where there are multiple options.

For skills not yet installed: tell the user which ones to install before proceeding and wait for confirmation.

```
Skills ready to load: [list]
Skills to install first: [list with install commands]

Install missing skills, then confirm to proceed.
```

**Do not start implementing until the user confirms skills are in order.**

Once confirmed: load each installed skill's SKILL.md before writing any code.

---

## Mode A: Creative Build

### How it works

1. Read the feature file — understand: user flow, states, business rules, must-haves
2. Read relevant existing code (to understand current state before changing anything)
3. Draft file map if >2 files, run Step 3.5 (skills matching), then: "Skills confirmed + file map approved — proceeding."
4. Implement in small chunks that the user can review
5. After each chunk: "done, test it — build passes (0 errors), TS clean"
6. User tests in browser, gives feedback
7. On correction: implement correction → ask "Add to CLAUDE.md Learned Rules?"
8. Atomic commit on approval: `git commit -m "feat: [feature] — [what was built]"`
9. Update STATE.md: increment task count for this feature

### Communication Rules (both modes)

- **Questions go at the end.** Structure every message as: status/update first → separator (`---`) → numbered questions with options. Never bury a question inside reasoning.
- **Number all options.** Even binary choices get numbers: "1. Tailwind 2. CSS Modules". User should be able to reply with just a number.
- **Minimize noise.** Don't show every file edit blow-by-blow. Batch small changes, give one summary. Save detailed output for things the user needs to review.

### Rules — Mode A

**Banned completion phrases (Red Flag Language):**
- "should work", "should pass" → run the command, show the output
- "probably works", "likely fine" → run the command, show the output
- "seems correct", "seems to work" → run the command, show the output
- "looks good", "I believe this passes" → run the command, show the output
- "Done!" / "All done!" → show evidence first, then state completion
- "It works" → show what command proved it works

If you catch yourself reaching for hedging language, you haven't verified. Go run the gate function.

**Required gate function before every "done, test it":**
1. `npm run build` (or equivalent) → must pass with 0 errors
2. `npx tsc --noEmit` → must report 0 TypeScript errors
3. Lint if configured → must pass
4. **Runtime smoke test** — if the feature has a critical path (file processing, data transformation, API call, PDF generation, etc.), verify it actually runs. Options:
   - Write and run a minimal test/script that exercises the critical path
   - If it's a UI feature, verify the dev server renders without console errors
   - Build clean ≠ works correctly. A TypeScript-clean app can still crash at runtime on `undefined` property access, missing imports, or wrong data shapes.

If any check fails → fix it. Then run all checks again. Then claim done using the evidence format:
```
done, test it:
✅ npm run build → Exit 0, 0 errors → "Build passes"
✅ npx tsc --noEmit → Exit 0 → "TypeScript clean"
✅ [critical path test] → [output] → "[what it proves]"
```

**When stuck or something breaks:**
Check `docs/debug/` for an active debug session for this feature (`status: active` in frontmatter, `feature` matches current feature name). If one exists, invoke `/gsr:debug resume <slug>` to continue it. If none exists, invoke `/gsr:debug` to start a new session. Return to build flow after the session reaches `status: resolved`.

**When the user makes a correction:**
After implementing: "This is now the expected behavior. Should I add this to CLAUDE.md Learned Rules so it applies to future work?"

---

## Mode B: Systematic Build

### How it works

1. Read the feature file — identify all systematic tasks
2. Generate task list with explicit pass/fail criteria:

```
Task list for [feature] — systematic mode:

1. [Task] — Done when: [grep shows X / tests pass / build clean]
2. [Task] — Done when: [specific verifiable criterion]
3. [Task] — Done when: [...]

Parallelizable: tasks [1, 2] can run simultaneously (no file overlap)
Sequential: task [3] depends on [1]
```

3. **Run Step 3.5 (skills matching).** Match skills to tasks, present verification table, wait for user to confirm skills before proceeding.

4. **Write plan file before the approval gate.** Create `docs/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<feature-slug>.md` from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/plan-md.md`. Fill in: feature slug, skills confirmed list, and the full task table with Status `pending` for all rows and parallelization map.

   Then present the approval gate:
   > Task list saved to `docs/plans/<slug>.md` — it'll stay there across `/clear`. Approve to execute?
   > (Task list shown above for review.)

   This gate is non-negotiable. Do not start executing until the user approves.

5. Execute tasks — parallelizable ones via subagent implementers:
   - Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/implementer.md` for the implementer agent role
   - Dispatch via the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "gsr:implementer"` — model and role come from the agent definition
   - Each agent gets: task description, CLAUDE.md content, feature file content, file boundaries, success criteria
   - In systematic mode, dispatch two staged reviewers after each implementer:
     1. **Stage 1 — Spec:** read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/reviewer-spec.md`. Dispatch via the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "gsr:reviewer-spec"` — model and role come from the agent definition.
        - SPEC_PASS → proceed to Stage 2
        - SPEC_FAIL → fail task back to implementer (or escalate to user if it's a product decision). Do not run Stage 2.
        - NEEDS_INFO → surface question to user, await answer, re-run Stage 1
     2. **Stage 2 — Quality:** read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/reviewer-quality.md`. Dispatch via the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "gsr:reviewer-quality"` — model and role come from the agent definition.
        - APPROVED or APPROVED_WITH_CONCERNS → task done, update plan file
        - CHANGES_REQUESTED → fail task back to implementer
   - After each implementer+reviewer cycle: update the task's row in `docs/plans/<slug>.md` — set Status to `done` (or `failed`), write the commit SHA and gate output in the Evidence column. Update `updated` in frontmatter.

6. For ≥3 agents or ≥10 files: use worktree isolation (Decision 25)
   - Each agent in its own git worktree
   - Sequential merge after all complete
   - Single wiring pass (shared files, consistency check) after merge

7. Atomic commit per task with evidence: `git commit -m "feat: [task] — build passes, 0 TS errors, 12/12 tests pass"`

8. Mini-verification after each task:
   - `npm run build` → 0 errors
   - `npx tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors
   - Lint if configured → pass
   Fix before committing. Never commit a broken build.

9. Set `status: complete` in `docs/plans/<slug>.md` frontmatter. Update `updated`. Then update STATE.md.

### Parallelization Heuristic

Parallelize when: task → file mapping has no file appearing twice.

**Parallelize:** i18n (per screen), testing (per feature), accessibility audit (per component)
**Don't parallelize:** refactoring (cascades), shared state changes, cross-file dependencies

---

## Step 4: STATE.md Update

After feature is complete (user approved or all systematic tasks done):

Update `docs/STATE.md`:
- Feature status: `in progress` → `done`
- Last updated: today's date

**Phase completion check:** After updating, check if this was the last feature in the current phase (all features in the phase are now `done`).

- **If yes — last feature in phase:**
  ```
  ✓ All features in [Phase N] are done.
  Next: run `/gsr:verify` to verify the full phase before moving to Phase [N+1].
  ```
  Set `Next action` in STATE.md to: "Run `/gsr:verify` — all Phase [N] features done"

- **If no — more features remain:**
  Set `Next action` in STATE.md to: "Run `/gsr:build` → pick next feature from Phase [N]"

## Iron Law Enforcement

Red flags — if you're thinking any of these, stop:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "The build probably passes, I'll skip checking" | Run the gate function. No shortcuts. |
| "This correction is obvious, I don't need to ask about CLAUDE.md" | Ask. The user decides what goes in Learned Rules. |
| "I'll skip skills matching for this simple feature" | Run Step 3.5. Always. Skills prevent the most expensive mistakes. |
| "The user hasn't responded to my completion message, must mean it's fine" | Wait for explicit approval before committing. |
| "I'll combine a few small fixes into one commit" | Atomic commits. One per task. Reviewable, bisectable. |
| "I'll use a placeholder image URL for now" | No. Use inline SVG, CSS, unicode, or text. Never reference nonexistent assets. (Iron Law #4) |
| "The user can test Configure even though it's not built yet" | Only test what's built. Never give test tasks for placeholders. (Iron Law #5) |
| "The user said build all, but I should still ask about each feature" | Respect batch mode. Only stop for blocking errors or product decisions. |
