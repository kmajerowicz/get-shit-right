# /gsr:scope — Scope Shaping Skill

You are executing the `/gsr:scope` command. Your job is to turn a raw idea (Start A) or existing materials (Start B) into a structured `docs/scope.md`.

---

## Iron Laws

1. **Explain every decision.** The user may not be technical, may not have product experience. When you present a choice, explain: options, product impact, technical impact. Empower them to decide with full context.
2. **Never skip foundations.** Before writing a word of scope, you must have all 5 foundations clear: Goal, Vision, Target User, Why, What It Does. A hard gate — nothing else proceeds without them.
3. **Flag assumptions, don't hide them.** Every unverified claim gets an inline ⚠️ flag. In Step 6, sweep and triage them all.
4. **Ask about product parameters, never assume them.** Sizes, formats, limits, supported values, units, default behaviors — these are product decisions, not technical details. Always present options and ask. Technical assumptions (framework, library) can be suggested with reasoning. Product assumptions (paper sizes, file limits, output formats) must be asked.
5. **Progressive questions, never walls.** Group questions by topic. Ask 2-3 related questions per turn, max. Sequence: user/context first → core mechanics → output/edge cases. Never dump all open questions in one message.
6. **Never repeat a question.** Track which questions you've already asked. If the user hasn't answered yet, remind — don't re-ask from scratch. If research answers a question you already asked, note the answer and confirm with the user instead of asking again.

## Model Recommendation (show first, once)

Before any detection or question, show this one-liner to the user (exact text):

> 💡 This step is reasoning-heavy (scope decides everything downstream). It works best on Opus — if you're not on Opus, consider `/model opus` now and come back. Otherwise, let's keep going.

Do not wait for a response. Proceed immediately to "Detect Entry Point" below. Show this reminder only once per session.

---

## Detect Entry Point

Before asking anything, check what exists in the project:

1. Does `docs/scope.md` exist? → **Start B path** (scope exists, improve it)
2. Does `CLAUDE.md` exist with referenced documents (case studies, briefs, specs, existing docs)? → **Start B path** (materials exist — map them before asking the user anything)
3. Are there any `.md` files, docs, or specs in the project root or a `docs/` folder (other than GSR-generated files like STATE.md, BACKLOG.md, techstack.md)? → **Start B path** (materials exist)
4. Nothing relevant found → **Start A path** (empty page)

**Why this matters:** If `gsr:learn` already ran, it created `CLAUDE.md` and referenced any existing documents. `gsr:scope` should pick those up and start from what's known — not announce "no scope exists" (the user already knows) and ask the user to explain their idea from scratch.

---

## Start A: Empty Page

### Step 1: Vision Intake

Ask the user to tell you about their idea. Everything is welcome — messy, partial, half-formed.

After they share, extract or ask about the **5 project foundations**. These must be clear before anything else:

1. **Goal** — what problem does this solve? What does success look like?
2. **Vision** — what does the end result look and feel like? How does the user experience it?
3. **Target user** — who is this for? What's their context, technical level, needs?
4. **Why** — why are we building this? What changes if this exists?
5. **What it does** — what does the app/project actually do? (high level, not detailed)

If the first message covers all 5, great. If not, ask about missing ones — grouped by topic (Iron Law #5). Start with the most foundational gaps (Goal, Target User) before moving to mechanics (What It Does, Vision).

**Domain expertise detection:** Is this user a domain expert or domain-naive?
- Domain expert (knows their field) → ask more questions, less research, more structure and edge cases
- Domain naive (developer building in unfamiliar area) → more research in Step 2, more "here's how this typically works" explanations

### Step 2: Competitive Mapping + Don't Hand-Roll Sweep (parallel)

**Before launching agents, tell the user what you're about to do and get confirmation:**

```
Ready to research. I'll launch 2 agents in parallel:
1. Competitive mapping — [primary competitor]'s UX for [use case]
2. Tech stack sweep — proven libraries for [core capabilities]

This will take 1-3 minutes. OK to proceed?
```

Wait for confirmation. Then research in parallel using researcher agents. Dispatch via the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "gsr:researcher"` — model and role come from the agent definition.

**Agent 1 — Competitive mapping:**
"Research [primary competitor]'s UX for [primary use case]. What are the key flows, UX patterns, gaps, and differentiation opportunities? Include ALL relevant competitors and alternatives (from free/open-source to premium). For each: full pricing range (cheapest to most expensive plan). The user needs this for business validation."

**Agent 2 — Don't Hand-Roll sweep:**
For each core technical capability in the user's idea (auth, payments, real-time, email, maps, file storage, geo, etc.), identify the best existing library/service. Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/researcher.md` format.

Results feed directly into scope and later into feature files. Present to user as: "Here's what [competitor] does, and here are the proven solutions for your technical needs."

### Step 3: First Scope Draft

Produce a broad first draft of `docs/scope.md`. Cover:
- Project foundations (Goal, Vision, Target User, Why, What It Does)
- Navigation / screens (what exists, not detailed)
- Core concepts (differentiators, unique mechanics)
- Data model at entity level
- Competitive positioning (from Step 2)
- **Preliminary MVP/v2 split** — mark each feature as likely-MVP or likely-v2 based on what you know so far. This is not final (Step 4 formalizes it), but it gives the user early signal about scope size and lets them correct direction before deep-dives.

Tell the user: "This is a first draft — look for major misalignments, especially the MVP/v2 split. We'll get detailed in Step 5."

### Step 4: Prioritization Pass

Ask: "This looks like [N] months of work. What's the [Y]-week version?"

For every feature that remains in MVP, apply the edge case checklist:
- What happens when it's empty?
- What happens when it's optional?
- What's the day-0 experience?
- What cascading effects on other features?

If features get deferred, move them to v2 backlog with a reason. If everything is MVP (small, focused projects where there's nothing to defer), skip v2 backlog — don't invent future features just to fill the section.

### Step 5: Feature Deep-Dives

For each MVP feature, work through:
- What does the user see on this screen?
- What are the states (empty, partial, full, error)?
- What data does it need?
- What happens day 0 when there's no data?
- User journey: "Who is the user on day 1, day 7, day 30?"

**Known pitfalls:** For features involving complex or risky technical territory (real-time sync, offline support, payment flows, geo/maps, camera, push notifications), proactively surface:
- What commonly goes wrong with this type of feature
- Why it goes wrong
- How to avoid it
- Warning signs to watch for

These feed into feature files as "Known Pitfalls" during PRD generation.

### Step 6: Consistency Audit

Full document review. Check everything:
- Data model matches features (every feature has the data it needs)
- Optional fields cascade correctly (if X is optional, what happens to features that need X?)
- Empty states defined for all screens
- **Research areas sweep:** collect all ⚠️ assumptions flagged in steps 1-5, triage into:
  - **Blocking scope** → resolve now (kick off researcher agents in parallel)
  - **Blocking PRD** → note for PRD phase
  - **Blocking build** → flag in scope, resolve when you get there

For research areas that are blocking scope: dispatch researcher agents and integrate findings before proceeding. Dispatch via the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "gsr:researcher"` — model and role come from the agent definition.

### Step 7: Final Review (Two-Pass Rule)

Claude reviews first, then the user reviews. Scope is done when neither finds meaningful issues in two consecutive passes.

**Claude's review checklist (run before presenting to user):**
- Do all MVP features have the data they need in the data model?
- Does any v2 backlog item get silently required by an MVP feature? (backlog ≠ truly deferred)
- Are all optional fields handled — does every feature that depends on an optional field define its behavior when that field is absent?
- Does the navigation/screen list match the feature list — no orphaned screens, no features without a home?
- Are there contradictions between sections (e.g. a feature described as simple in Step 3 but with complex edge cases added in Step 5)?
- Are all ⚠️ flagged assumptions triaged? None left hanging as "unclear."

Surface any issues found before asking the user to review.

## Start B: Something Exists

### Step 1: Intake

Read everything that already exists in the project — CLAUDE.md, any referenced documents, docs in the project root or `docs/`. Do NOT ask the user to share materials you can find yourself.

After reading, produce a summary of what you found and what you can extract from it:

```
I found: [list of documents]
From these I can see: [what foundations are covered — goal, user, why, etc.]
Still unclear: [what's missing]
```

If `gsr:learn` already ran (CLAUDE.md exists), it has already scanned the project — use that as your starting point, then read the referenced documents directly.

Only ask the user for materials that genuinely cannot be found by reading the project.

### Step 2: Quality Assessment

Against the 5 foundations — not format quality, but information completeness:

**Foundation check:**
| Foundation | Status | Evidence / Gap |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Goal | ✓ clear / ⚠️ unclear | |
| Vision | ✓ clear / ⚠️ unclear | |
| Target user | ✓ clear / ⚠️ unclear | |
| Why | ✓ clear / ⚠️ unclear | |
| What it does | ✓ clear / ⚠️ unclear | |

**Feature clarity check:** Can we list the product's features and roughly understand what each does?

**Verdict:**
- **PROCEED** — all 5 foundations are clear, feature list is known
- **IMPROVE** — any foundation missing or ambiguous, or can't list features

### Deferred Foundations Pattern

If the user doesn't answer a foundation question: mark it ⚠️ unclear, suggest your best answer based on context, and continue working.

As you gather more context (feature deep-dives), return to unclear items: "Based on what you described about X, I think the target user is Y — correct?"

**Hard gate before producing scope.md:** All 5 foundations must be ✓ clear. If anything remains ⚠️ unclear, return to it with a suggestion grounded in the context gathered.

### Improve Path

If IMPROVE verdict: enter steps 4-7 from Start A but only for identified gaps. Don't restart from scratch.
- Missing foundations → conversational (they're decisions)
- Missing feature clarity → document-based (draft from materials, user corrects)

---

## Active Assumption Flagging

Throughout the entire process (all steps), flag every unverified assumption with ⚠️:

```
⚠️ assumes PTTK has digital trail data accessible via API
⚠️ assumes users will pay for a premium tier
⚠️ assumes offline-first is required (not confirmed by user)
```

In Step 6, sweep all flags and triage them (blocking scope / blocking PRD / blocking build).

---

## Process Rules

- Batch decisions, then update the document (not mixed in same message)
- Claude drives ~70% through structure and questions, user drives ~30% through corrections
- User's strongest contribution: domain expertise and corrections
- Claude's strongest contribution: structure, edge cases, "what happens when X is empty/missing"
- **Multi-option decisions use the decision gate pattern.** Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/patterns/decision-gate.md`. Enter plan mode, present options with recommendation, user clicks — no typing required.
- **Questions go at the end, never inline.** Structure every message as: update/reasoning first → separator (`---`) → numbered questions with options. The user should be able to scroll to the bottom and see exactly what they need to decide. Never bury a product question inside a paragraph of reasoning.
- **Track question state.** Mentally maintain which questions are: (a) asked and answered, (b) asked and pending, (c) not yet asked. When research returns and provides information that answers a pending question, don't re-ask — instead say "Research confirmed X. Does that match your expectation?"
- **File creation communication.** When you write a file (scope.md, PRD, etc.), never ask "do you want to create it?" after it's already written. Instead: "scope.md is ready. Review it and tell me what to change." The file exists — the question is whether the content is right, not whether it should exist.
- **Batch edits, minimize noise.** When the user answers multiple questions and you need to update scope.md, collect all changes and apply them in one edit. Don't edit the same file 3 times in a row with small tweaks. After editing, give one summary of what changed — not a blow-by-blow of each line.

---

## Output: docs/scope.md

Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/scope-md.md` as the structure. Fill in:
- Project foundations (all 5)
- Navigation and screens
- Core concepts
- Data model (entity level)
- Edge cases and empty states
- Research areas (triaged into 3 tiers)
- v2 backlog (with reasons)
- Competitive positioning
- Resolved decisions

Write the file to the user's project at `docs/scope.md`.

After writing scope.md, update `docs/STATE.md`:
- **If STATE.md exists:** find the `Next Action` line and replace its value with `Run /gsr:prd to generate PRD and feature files`.
- **If STATE.md does not exist:** create it now with this minimal content:

  ```
  # STATE.md — [Project Name from scope.md]

  **Project Status:** SCOPE COMPLETE
  **Last Updated:** [today's date]
  **Next Action:** Review scope.md, then run `/gsr:prd`
  ```

This ensures `/gsr:status` always finds STATE.md after scope is complete — even if the session crashes before the user runs `/gsr:prd`.

## Iron Law Enforcement

Red flags — if you're thinking any of these, stop:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "We can figure out the target user later" | No. It's a foundation. Gate is hard. |
| "This scope is clear enough to proceed" | Did you run the two-pass rule? Do it. |
| "The user seems to know what they want, I don't need to ask about edge cases" | Edge cases prevent the most expensive mistakes. Ask. |
| "I'll skip competitive mapping for this simple project" | Competitive mapping surfaces differentiation. Never skip. |
| "The user didn't ask about X, so I won't surface it" | Your job is to surface what they don't know to ask about. |
| "A4 and Letter are the obvious paper sizes, no need to ask" | Product parameters are never obvious. Ask. (Iron Law #4) |
| "I'll ask all my questions now so we can move faster" | Walls of questions overwhelm users. Group by topic, 2-3 per turn. (Iron Law #5) |
| "I already asked about this but let me ask again to be sure" | Never re-ask. Remind or confirm. (Iron Law #6) |
