# Phase 3: Build

**Two modes, selected by prompt within `/gsr:build`. User picks a feature to build, then chooses the mode. Features are grouped into build phases defined in the PRD.**

---

## Mode A: Creative Build (human-in-the-loop)

**When:** UI components, screens, interactions, design-sensitive features — anything the user will see and judge.

### How
1. User gives a small, scoped task: "Build the dashboard (see `docs/features/dashboard.md`)"
2. System reads the feature file → loads project-wide skills from `techstack.md` → feature-specific skills matched dynamically in Step 3.5
3. Claude reads CLAUDE.md (conventions, references, learned rules)
4. Plan mode if >2 files, direct implementation otherwise
   - Plans follow the structured format in `docs/patterns/plan-execution.md` — file map first, then task breakdown with checkpoints. User approves the file map before execution begins.
5. User reviews every diff, tests in browser
6. User corrects → Claude asks "Add this to CLAUDE.md Learned Rules?"
7. Atomic commit after user approves
8. STATE.md auto-updates (task count incremented)

### Rules
- Claude always says "done, test it" or "still need X" — never "should work"
- Before saying done: code compiles, no TS errors, build passes
- Skills are enforced by the workflow (loaded from feature file), not by Claude remembering a rule
- Before committing, Claude highlights key review points from the code review checklist (`docs/patterns/code-review.md`) — focusing on integration safety and what the user should manually verify

### Mini-verification per task
Before telling the user "done, test it," Claude runs the gate function (see Phase 4) at minimum Tier 1:
1. `npm run build` (or equivalent) — must pass with 0 errors
2. `npx tsc --noEmit` — must report 0 TypeScript errors
3. Lint if configured — must pass

If any check fails, Claude fixes the issue before claiming done. The claim must reference the output: "done, test it — build passes (0 errors), TS clean." Never "done, should work."

### Debugging
When a bug or unexpected behavior occurs during build, switch to the systematic debugging process (see `docs/patterns/systematic-debugging.md`). Resume normal build flow after the fix is verified.

---

## Mode B: Systematic Build (agent-driven with verification)

**When:** Testing, i18n, accessibility, security hardening, performance — anything with clear pass/fail criteria and no design judgment.

### How
1. User describes the systematic task
2. Claude generates task list with pass/fail criteria
   - Task lists follow the plan execution protocol in `docs/patterns/plan-execution.md` — including file map and checkpoint after each task.
3. User approves the list (gate — nothing executes without approval)
4. Claude executes tasks (parallelizable where independent)
5. Atomic commit per task
6. Verification report with grep-based evidence
7. User spot-checks results

### Rules
- Agent reads CLAUDE.md and all accumulated corrections before starting
- If agent encounters ambiguity requiring product judgment → stops and asks, never decides autonomously
- Verification is evidence-based: grep results, test output, build status
- Subagents follow the role separation and status protocol defined in `docs/patterns/subagent-patterns.md`. Each task dispatched to an implementer subagent includes full context handoff. In systematic mode, a reviewer subagent checks each implementer's output before the commit using the code review checklist (`docs/patterns/code-review.md`) covering spec compliance, integration safety, convention adherence, and regression risk.

### Mini-verification per task
As part of each atomic commit cycle, before committing, the agent runs the gate function (see Phase 4) at minimum Tier 1:
1. `npm run build` — must pass with 0 errors
2. `npx tsc --noEmit` — must report 0 TypeScript errors
3. Lint if configured — must pass

If any check fails, the agent fixes before committing. Commit messages include evidence: "feat: add i18n for dashboard — build passes, 0 TS errors, 12/12 tests pass."

### Debugging
When a bug or unexpected behavior occurs during build, switch to the systematic debugging process (see `docs/patterns/systematic-debugging.md`). Resume normal build flow after the fix is verified.

## Task Classification Heuristic

If the task requires taste, empathy, or design judgment → creative (Mode A).
If it has clear pass/fail criteria and no design judgment → systematic (Mode B).

| Task Type | Mode | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| UI components | Creative | Taste, design quality |
| Screen layouts | Creative | Information density, feel |
| New features (first time) | Creative | Product decisions |
| Bug fixes | Creative | Root cause needs context |
| Testing | Systematic | Clear pass/fail |
| i18n | Systematic | Mechanical extraction |
| Accessibility | Systematic | Checklist-based |
| Security hardening | Systematic | Checklist-based |
| Refactoring | Systematic + human review | Pattern-based but verify nothing broke |

---

## Parallelization

Independent systematic tasks can run in parallel via multiple agents. All parallel agents share the same CLAUDE.md context — they run concurrently but with the same instruction manual and accumulated corrections. Parallel subagents follow the dispatch patterns in `docs/patterns/subagent-patterns.md`. Each gets independent context — no shared state between parallel agents except CLAUDE.md conventions.

Specific parallelization opportunities:
- Independent systematic tasks in sweep mode
- Verification checks (grep, tests, build — all independent)
